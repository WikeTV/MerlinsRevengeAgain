u: Merlin! Be careful! 

u: He means to steal your powers!

m: Blast! I can't believe I fell for that.

u teleportInAt 50

u: Right...

u walkTo 100

u: ...well I couldn't get it all but I managed to turn some of your power back into potions and such.

u: You'll find most of it on the first few screens.

m: Great! Thanks!

m: I'll be off then...

m walkTo 500

u: Hold up there Speedy!

u walkTo 300

u: I need to tell you some other stuff.

m walkTo 400

u: Ochre has got in with a bad crowd.

m: Who?

u: The Magical Alliance!

m: Gasp!

m: So?

u: So, they have this thing which can dampen your powers down to almost nothing.

m: Really? How does that work?

u: No time to explain.

u: The point is you will need an alternative weapon for when you face them.

u: To be more precise, you will need to use the most powerful weapon know to this world!

m: Wow! Sounds cool, what is it?

u: A Bloke With A Sword!

m: ?

m: Q'est que ce que ca?

m: Come again?

u: Blokes with swords are not affected by magic reducing thingys.

u: Surely you know that?

m: Well not affected no, but they're not great at staying in one piece in the face of an energy blast either are they?

u: Well no.

m: And presumably the Magical Alliance has something similar to an Energy Blast do they?

u: Similar yes, slightly more powerful in fact.

m: Great.

u: But look, so long as you train them up sufficiently they should be able to handle it.

u: And you can always use monks to heal them.

m: Hmmm. And how do I train them up?

u: By letting them kill stuff, the more stuff they kill, the stronger and better they will get.

m: Ok, this sounds like a challenge.

u: You'd best get started.

m: One more thing before I go.

m: Do you know where Berlin is?

u: He is nearby but I cannot tell you more than that.

u: The blue squares in the mini-map indicate where you can find blokes with swords and other people to add to your army.

u: Berlin will also show up blue. That should get you started.

u: Good luck!

m: Thanks, boss!
