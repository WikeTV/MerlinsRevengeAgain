m: Right then, so what should we do?

u: eh?

m: You said you'd know what to do when level 3 was done.

u: I did?

m: Yeah, well I'm pretty sure you did.

u: Oh right. Erm. Er.

m: You don't have a clue do you?

u: Yes I do! Er, I think we should gather all the wizards together and then go after the Black Sorcerer.

m: And the evil ones?

u: We'll have to defeat them, and convert them back to good again.

m: Well, while you're doing that I'm going to head back to the end of MR2, maybe I'll find some clues or something.

u: Ok.
