u: Well done, you've completed the beta!

m: Thanks!

u: Were there any issues that came up while you were playing?

m: Er, maybe.

u: Well if there were, you can write in and let the bloke who makes this know.

m: Ok.

m: How do I know whether to write a contact form, suggestion, or bug report?

u: Ok, a bug report is for when the game doesn't function as it was intended to. eg crashes. Sometimes it's hard to tell what was intended, but there it is.

u: Suggestions are for ideas that could improve the game. They can be commented on and rated by other members. If used, your name goes in the credits.

u: Contact Form is for quick feedback and for suggesting very small tweaks or issues. Ideas used from contact forms are not credited in the game.

m: Thanks!

u: See you next time!
