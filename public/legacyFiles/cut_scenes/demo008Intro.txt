u: Hey, Hey, Hey!

m: ?

u: Have I got something special for you!

m: I dunno, have you?

u: I dunno, have I?

m: You're very hyper, have you been at that coffee again?

u: Nope, I've been at that spell inventing machine again.

m: What spell inventing machine?

u: Well, alright, there isn't a spell inventing machine. But I found this...

u produceProp bls

m: Oooh, the Monster Summon!

u: Yeah, that's what I thought. But it doesn't summon monsters - this time it's people.

u walkTo 300

m: People Summon!?

u: Better than that, the People-With-Swords-and-Things Summon!!

u dropProp

u: Go ahead, try it out!

m: Ok!
m walkTo 220

u: And that's not all!

m: Oh?

u: They - and you - can level up now.

m: Crikey.

u: And you can unsummon them by firing a blank blast at them.

m: Oh right.

m: Er, why would I want to do that?

u: When you unsummon them, their health will be repaired by er, me!

m: By you?

u: Yup, but you, er, won't see me doing that. I'll er, be in a different plane of existance.

m: Ok, I'm just going to accept that.

u: Right. And then, when you summon them again I'll teleport in your best man...

u: ...if you've got one in your reserve army.

m: My reserve army?

u: Yeah. Basically, the people you unsummoned.

m: This sounds a bit confusing...

u: Don't worry it's easier than it sounds, just have a go! 

u: And unsummon people if they're flashing red.

m: Right Ok!
