u: Merlin!

m: Hello Ulin.

u: How *are* you?

m: Erm, fine thanks.

u: Good.

m: And you?

u: Fine, fine.

u: Just the small matter of absolute mayhem breaking out.

m: Lol. Nothing new there then.

u: Wait, isn't that the same line from the last demo?

u: Actually, it doesn't matter.

u: Merlin, there is no easy way to say this.

m: Oh? What is it?

u: The Magical Alliance have arrived in these parts.

m: Oh.

u: The goblins and skeletons have brought in reinforcements.

m: Oh, er.

u: And the Ninjas have started appearing out of mysterious clouds.

m: Oh. Um. What's that?

u: I dunno. It's a mystery.

m: Right yes. Should've known.

u: And there are Karate Guys around as well.

u: If you see one of them beating up one of your warriors, my advice would be to get him out of there!

m: Right, ok. So what's my task?

u: Same as usual, clear it all up!

u: Some screens have been populated by one group or another.

u: Some are still being fought over. As usual, use this to your advatange.

m: Right ho.

u: There are two energy blast scrolls in the level.

u: Collecting the second one won't make any difference to you, since you'll already know the spell.

m: Righty dokey.

u: There are plenty of potions around so you shouldn't find it too difficult.

u: Good luck!

m: Thanks matey!

m exitStageRight

u: Have fun!
