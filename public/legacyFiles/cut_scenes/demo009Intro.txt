u: Ah, Merlin. Good man.

m: Hello Ulin.

u: Yes, yes, take a seat would you?

m: Erm, I haven't really got the anims for that.

m: Plus, the bloke who makes this hasn't drawn a chair.

u: Oh right.

u: Well, just stand there then there's a good chap.

m: Ok.

m: *muttering* I would have done that anyway...

u: Sorry?

m: Eh? Oh nothing, just talking about the football.

u: Right. Well look, I've got a very important task for you.

m: Lol. Nothing new there then.

u: Wait, did you just say "lol" or actually laugh?

u: Actually, it doesn't matter.

u: There are more pressing matters at hand.

u: You are aware of our order's zero tolerance policy on goblins and skeletons?

m: Of course. I live and die by that policy.

m: It is the center of my soul.

m: It strikes to the very core of my being.

u: "Yes" would have sufficed.

u: And if that happens you know what it means!

m: *gasp*

m: They become...

m: ...I hardly dare say it!

m: They become *slightly harder to kill*!

u: Precisely! We can't have that.

u: Kill all the ninjas along with everything else.

u: Use that to your advantage.

m: Right you are skip!
