u: Ok, on this level you have to punch your way to the energy blast spell.

u: Which is three screens East of the start.

u: Then use it to blast your way through the rest of the level and clear the map.

m: Sounds straightforward enough.

u: Yes indeed. And you can now save and re-load the game whenever you like.

m: Cool.

u: And there are sound effects, which can be switched on and off.

m: Ok.

u: And the game will take you to a short end sequence when you clear the map now.
