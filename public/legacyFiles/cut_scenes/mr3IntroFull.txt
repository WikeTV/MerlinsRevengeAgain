m: long programme, this.

tv: meh, meh, moo

u: yep. I feel like I've been watching it for ever.

m: do you think level 3 is done yet?

u: Yes... yes I do.

u: I can feel it in me bones.

tv: >Click< ...

m turnToFace u

m: Right then, so what should we do?

u: eh?

m: You said you'd know what to do when level 3 was done.

u: I did?

m: Yeah, well I'm pretty sure you did.

u: Oh right. Erm. Er.

m: You don't have a clue do you?

u: Yes I do! Er, I think we should gather all the wizards together and then go after the Black Sorcerer.

m: And the evil ones?

u: We'll have to defeat them, and convert them back to good again.

m: Right Ok. That sounds good.

m: Where are they?

u: Sorry?

m: The wizards, where are they?

u: Er, um. 

u: I dunno, I think I better read some magical tomes or something.

u produceProp ws

u: Maybe that'll help.

u walkTo 400

m: Yeah maybe.

m: Well, while you're doing that I'm going to head back to the end of MR2, maybe I'll find some clues or something.

u: Ok.

m: Who's there?

o: 'Tis I!

o: The Ochre Wizard!

m: Ulp...

m: Er,

m: I can't see you.

o: Hang on a sec, I can't get this damn animal to move...

o: Ah-ha! That's better!

o: Fancy a drink?

m: Ooh, I am a bit thirsty as it happens.

o dropProp

o: Here try some...

o walkTo 500

m: Hah! No chance!

m: You must think I'm an idiot!

m: An evil wizard offers you a black bottle with a skull on it?

m: What do you take me for?

m: It's obviously going to kill me!

o: No it won't, I swear!

o: It's just for the thirst.

o: Hang on a sec, I've got some testimonials here.

o produceProp ws

o: These are from other wizards who have drunk that potion.

o: Er, I mean innocent drink. Hehe.

o: Ahem!

o: "Nope I'm definitely not dead," says one.

o: Another says, "Hmm... well I guess I am still alive."

o: And yet another: "Well, technically I am still alive I suppose."

o: I could go on...

o putAwayProp

m: I'm sure you could!

m: I'm sure that you could make up testimonials all day!

o: I'm offended! These are all real!

o: For example, that last one was from er...

o produceProp ws

o: hang on...

o: Berlin the Purple.

o: Do you know him?

o putAwayProp

m: You bounder! You know where Berlin is?

o: Oh dear, are you alright? You suddenly seem a little agitated!

m: Tell me where he is! Is he safe?

o: Ho ho, don't worry he's alive... for now.

o: I don't know how long he'll be able to hold out though.

m: Hold out against what? You tell me where he is right now!

o: The drink, Merlin.

m: You rotter!

m: Hmph!

m walkTo 250

m: And if I drink this accursed thing, you'll tell me where Berlin is?

o: Well, put it this way, I won't if you don't.

m: I do still seem to be alive, though.

o: Thank you. Another testimonial!

o: "I - do - still - seem - to - be - alive - though".

o putAwayProp

m: So what did that do to me?

o: Not much, just took away all your powers and spells from the last game.

m: Oh poo.

u: Not so fast Ochre!

m: Ulin!

o: Ulin!

u: Merlin! Be careful! 

u: He means to steal your powers! 

m: It's too late. He's already done it!

o: Right, well I'll be off...

o walkTo 650

m: Hey! You come back here Ochre!

o: or what?

u: Let him go, we have more urgent matters to attend to.

u: Tell me how he stole your powers.

u: Did he use a black potion?

m: Yes!

u: With a skull on it?

m: Yes!

u: Then I must act quickly!

u: Back in a tick.

o exitStageRight

m: Blast! I can't believe I fell for that potion trick.

m: He didn't even tell me where Berlin was.

u teleportInAt 50

u: Right...

u walkTo 100

u: ...well I couldn't get it all but I managed to turn some of your power back into potions and such.

u: You'll find most of it on the first few screens.

m: Great! Thanks!

m: I'll be off then...

m walkTo 500

u: Hold up there Speedy Gonzales!

u walkTo 300

u: I need to tell you some other stuff.

m walkTo 400

u: Ochre has got in with a bad crowd.

m: Who?

u: The Magical Alliance!

m: Gasp!

m: So?

u: So, they are hiding out in the Magical Forest.

m: So?

u: So, they have drained all the Magic out of it!

m: Gulp!

m: Nope still don't get it.

u: That's bad because when you go in there, you won't be able to summon your spells as well as normal.

u: No magic around see?

m: Oh dear, that's not good.

u: Indeed not. 

u: You will need an alternative weapon for when you face them.

u: To be more precise, you will need to use the most powerful weapon known to this world!

m: Wow! Sounds cool, what is it?

u: A Bloke With A Sword!

m: ?

m: Q'est que ce que ca?

m: Come again?

u: Blokes with swords are not affected by magic reducing situations.

u: Surely you know that?

m: Well not affected no, but they're not great at staying in one piece in the face of an energy blast either are they?

u: Well no.

m: And presumably the Magical Alliance has something similar to an Energy Blast do they?

u: Similar yes, slightly more powerful in fact.

m: Great.

u: But look, so long as you train them up sufficiently they should be able to handle it.

u: And you can always use monks to heal them.

m: Hmmm. And how do I train them up?

u: By letting them kill stuff, the more stuff they kill, the stronger and better they will get.

m: Ok, that sounds good.

u: You'll need the army summon spell to summon and unsummon your units.

m: Right, and where is that?

u: It's in the Scarlet Wizard's storeroom due north of here.

u: Fire a 'blank' blast at a unit to unsummon them.

u: I will lurk in the ether and instantly heal any units you unsummon.

m: Thanks, that will be useful.

m: And how do I summon?

u: Charge a blast until you see the icon representing the unit you want to summon.

u: Then fire it where you want the unit to appear.

u: Don't fire at trees or rock or the unit won't appear.

u: If the icon is faded out, it means there are none of that unit type in your army.

u: If you have 8 units on screen already, the army summon won't charge past 'blank'.

m: Right, ok. All understood.

u: Have you got the Golden Machine Gun with you?

m: Dang, I left it back at the flat!

m: Er, I mean at the Towers Of The Aldevar.

u: Well, there's no time to go back for it now.

u: You'd best get started.

m: One more thing before I go.

m: Do you know where Berlin is?

u: He is nearby but I cannot tell you more than that.

u: The blue squares in the mini-map indicate where you can find blokes with swords and other people to add to your army.

u: Berlin will also show up blue. That should get you started.

u: Good luck!

m: Thanks, boss!
